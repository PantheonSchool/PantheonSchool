                <p>The Pantheon School follows a child â€”centric unique curriculum to develop each child's inherent potential. The entire learning process is well phased out across four distinctive learning stages designed to help every child to realize his/her talent to the fullest. Our approach is fostering a better understanding and igniting a curiosity and a joyous learning environment for the students. The entire content is mapped to the curriculum class-wise.</p>
                <p>A child learns in many ways - questioning adults, collaborating with peers, and experiencing the world through his or her unique perspective. The Pantheon School transforms these ways of learning into a methodology of relevance. This means that every child at our schools is equipped with a toolkit of concepts, skills and knowledge, which he or she can shape into endless possibilities and solutions. In a dynamic and shifting world, this kind of learning impacts individual growth as well as global consciousness.</p>
