            description: `I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the teachers for the efforts they are putting together to teach our children. Preparing lessons, making kids learn through fun, all this through distance learning. It is very difficult to teach such small kids online. However you all are making sure that each kid gets proper attention and the learning is smooth.
            I really appreciate the fact that focus is not just on finishing the syllabus but also ensuring that each kid is learning properly. The kids are also enjoying the co-curricular activities which are taking place along with the main subjects. It makes them look forward for the classes.
            It is indeed a very difficult time for all of us but the teachers are making sure that learning doesnâ€™t stop.
            Once again thank you to all the teachers who are helping my child learn today and everyday.`,
